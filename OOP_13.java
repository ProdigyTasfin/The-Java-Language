// Encapsulation is basically the wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit.
// In Java, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers to restrict access to the data members 
// of a class.

// Simple analogy: Think of a capsule (like a pill) that contains medicine. The capsule protects 
// the medicine inside from external factors, ensuring that it is only accessed in the intended way. 
// Similarly, encapsulation in programming protects the data and methods of a class from unintended 
// interference and misuse. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the data and ensures that it is 
// accessed and modified only through well-defined interfaces.
// Encapsulation provides several benefits:
// 1. Data Hiding: By restricting access to the internal state of an object, encapsulation helps in 
// protecting the data from unintended modifications.
// 2. Improved Maintainability: Encapsulated code is easier to maintain and modify since the internal 
// implementation can be changed without affecting external code.
// 3. Enhanced Security: Encapsulation helps in enforcing access control, ensuring that only authorized
// users can access or modify the data.
